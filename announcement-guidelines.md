# Announcement Guidelines
We supports many teams and organizations throughout the ecosystem. We often receive requests to participate in project announcements. Unfortunately, we don't do joint announcements and do not provide quotes.

In the context of the bounty programs, we ask teams not to make any announcements before **the first milestone has been accepted**. This is in order to protect the community from projects that only intend to use the bounty announcement to raise funds and/or interest but don't intend to deliver on the application. For this reason, we reserve the right to terminate the bounty if this rule is not observed. 

Once you have completed your milestone, we can help by reviewing and proofreading your blogpost.

## We recommend the following guidelines when writing your post
- The post should be strategic in nature, focusing on the tech rather than the "announcement" element.
- The team should point to the work, in order to attract attention for the project and demonstrate momentum in the ecosystem. It should be informative for builders and the larger community.
- The post should include a link to a GitHub repository or elsewhere to showcase what's been built so far.
- Suggested flow for the post:
  - This is what the team has built so far.
  - These are the team's future development plans.
  - This is how the technology will contribute to the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Key components

1. A blog post header image
   - An image helps when sharing the announcement on social networks. It's more prominent in feeds and looks more professional.
2. About your team
   - This is a chance to share more about your project and what it does.
   - You can also highlight additional use cases for this new project.
3. Why you chose to build
   - Describe the benefits of building on Polkadot, Kusama etc. (shared security, ease of use, ease of deployment, ease of interchain communication, decentralized, trusted, etc.) and why it was it important to have these features for your project.
4. Quote
   - Your CEO / CTO / Founder may want to include a quote of why they picked building out the project.
  
## Recommended language
  
1. Use specific verbs such as integrate, support or build.
2. Don't describe your technology as the "first" to build.
3. Don't indicate that Polkadot prefers a certain technology over all others:
   - Speak of the merits of the tech: "This technology provides great utility for the Polkadot network through..."
